 Guitar Instructor Website
  </h3>
  <p>This is a website built as an extension from a guitar school website, The purpose is to feature only the guest teachers from
different musicial genres and a describtion of their lesson course. The page lists 9 guitarists and includes images and a breif describtion 
of the instructor. The bottom of the website contains an RSVP form for customers to sign up.</p>

  <h3>Movie Theatre Site</h3>
  <p>
   This Theatre Project was a fun one! I utilized bootstrap as the framework for this website that would be used
 by a movie theatre. I presents the movies with a describtion on the card of the movies available, 
 movie showtimes and I cover photo of the movies within the card. This website has a detailed describtion of the history of Academy Cinemas, 
 and at the bottom of the website there is a submission form for customers to sign up for future rewards! Everything a theatre should ever need on a website!
