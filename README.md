   This Theatre Project was a fun one! I utilized bootstrap as the framework for this website that would be used
 by a movie theatre. I presents the movies with a describtion on the card of the movies available, 
 movie showtimes and I cover photo of the movies within the card. This website has a detailed describtion of the history of Academy Cinemas, 
 and at the bottom of the website there is a submission form for customers to sign up for future rewards! Everything a theatre should ever need on a website!
